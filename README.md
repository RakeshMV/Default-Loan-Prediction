Loan Default Prediction

Can you predict if an applicant will default the loan or not in the future?

Problem Statement

My Home is a finance company that lends housing loans at the best and most affordable interest rates to customers. In recent times, the company incurred heavy losses due to loan defaults. Most applicants failed to repay the loan as per the promissory note.

In order to avoid such losses, the company has decided to build a system for identifying the loan defaulters automatically based on data. This will help the company to identify the potential applicants and ensure the smooth running of the entire process.

Now, the company challenges the Data Science community to build a smart AI system to predict the probability of an applicant defaulting the loan or not in the future.
